Scenario 
Using one of the comparison operators in Python, write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input, 
which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.
Don't create any if blocks (we're going to talk about them very soon). Test your code using the data we've provided for you
"""

number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
print(number >= 100)
