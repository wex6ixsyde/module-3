Scenario

Your task is very simple here: write a program that uses a for loop to "count mississippily" to five. Having counted to five, the
program should print to the screen the final message "Ready or not, here I come!"
"""
"""
import time

# Write a for loop that counts to five.
for count in range(1, 6):
    print(count, "Mississippi")
    time.sleep(1)
print("Ready or not, here I come!")
"""
"""
for i in range(101):
    print("I'm sorry baby, won't do it again — I promise.")
